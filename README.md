# RISC-V assembler
A standalone assembler for RISC-V assembly. Currently, the Instruction sets that have been implemented are: RV32I, RV64I, RV32M, RV64M, and the "call", "mv", and "nop" pseudoinstructions

## Compiling
All you need is a C compiler and GNU make. Then you do:
```
git clone https://github.com/aslikr42069/RISC_V_assembler.git
cd RISC_V_assembler
make
```
and voila! You will have a binary file called "assemble", which you can use to assemble RISC-V assembly :))
